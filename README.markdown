A small jquery plugin to make a simple mailto link based on the current page for sharing via email.

Usage:

1. Include the script (you'll find it in the src folder)

<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.shareemail.js"></script>

2. Call the plugin on the element you wish to turn into the email link.

<script type="text/javascript">
  $(<selector>).shareEmail();
</script>

Where "<selector>" is the jQuery selector for the element.

See the test/index.html for an example.
